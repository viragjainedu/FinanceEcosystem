    title: 'Why do we need to plan our budget?',
    content: 'In this world, some are wise and some aren\'t. Same thing goes with budgeting. Some people tend to spend their money overwhelmingly until they realize that there\'s only few bucks left in the wallet.\n It is highly recommended to plan your budget to prevent such thing to happen in the future, especially for someone with a tight budget. The key of planning your budget is to control yourself -- in this case, your desire.',

    title: 'Internal vs External Factor',
    content: 'Internal factors are factors that can be controlled by you, where you have the choice to decide. (i.e. meal choice, fashion style, some entertainment, grocery product, etc.).\nWhether you\'re going to eat outside or cook by yourself at home, spend $50 for a hoodie or 10 pieces of T-Shirt, $100 gaming keyboard or $20 office membrane keyboard, buying newly released super rare in-game item or save it for something else, you decide.\nIn this factor, do not spend your money more than what you needed. (not by the amount you spent, but from the value you get from that amount of money).\n\nMeanwhile, external factors are uncontrollable factors that can only be controlled by other party. (i.e. housing by landlord or developer, transportation and electricity by government or corps, healthcare and tuition fee by the institution, etc.).\nAt first, you have option about which service/product you are going to use. Afterwards, it is flat cost. In this factor, pick the service/product which offer the best value for its price. Because, once you decide on it, it\'s hard to switch over.',

    title: 'The Scarcity Principle',
    content: 'The scarcity principle is an economic theory that explains relationship between dynamic supply and demand. When applied to the field of psychology, the scarcity principle basically states that the less available something is, the more desired it becomes.\n\n“A consumer who was debating whether or not to buy that product is more likely to go ahead with the purchase out of fear that it will go away and he or she will miss out,” \n\nIt is recommended to always evaluate the benefit of the limited-offered product/service based on what you need.',

    title: 'Sunk Cost Fallacy',
    content: 'In economics, a sunk cost is any past expense that has already been incurred and can’t be recovered. In the case of a business, for example, sunk costs might include machinery or equipment that was purchased. Since that money has been spent, it isn’t factored into future decisions regarding spending. \n\nOne common example is a gym membership. Maybe you signed up a few months ago and had to pay a hefty initiation fee. However, you don’t really love going to the gym after all and rarely make it. The truth is that you aren’t getting that money back regardless of whether you keep going to the gym or not. So why not save yourself the future cost of membership dues and just cancel?',

    title: 'Anchoring',
    content: 'Say you’re shopping for an item with a purchase price of $100. However, that item was marked on sale for $50. It’s likely that you’ll focus on the initial price of $100 (the anchor) and therefore consider the new price of $50 a great deal ― even if it isn’t. The original price might have been inflated, or you might not really need to spend the money in the first place. \n\n“By concentrating on the anchor, we are actually thinking more about the $50 we are saving than the $50 we are spending,”',

    title: 'Social Facilitation',
    content: 'Social facilitation is an improvement in the performance of a task in the presence of others (audience, competitor, co-actor) compared to their performance when alone. \n\nIn terms of your spending, social facilitation might give negative impact to your decision making. For example, you might want to buy a new pair of shoes after seeing your friend\'s shoes in a gathering, or buying a new skin for your in-game weapon after seeing random person\'s skin in a matchmaking.\n\nSo the next time you find yourself in the middle of a bidding war or a friend’s shopping spree, take a moment to breathe, let your heart rate slow and reconsider whether you’re really willing to spend that much.',

    title: 'Needs vs Wants',
    content: 'Needs point out the something you must have for survival. In ancient times, the three basic needs of the man are food, clothing and shelter. But, with the passage of time, education and healthcare also became integral. They are a person\'s first priority as they are the things that they keep us healthy and safe. Therefore, if needs are not satisfied in time, it may result in illness, inability in functioning properly or even death. \n\nOn the other hand, wants refers to something which is good to have, but not essential for survival. They are optional, i.e. an individual is going to survive, even if not satisfied. Further, wants may vary from person to person and time to time.\n\nQuick tip: if you are thinking about buying a new pair of shoes (or something) even though your shoes is still in "okay" condition, try to hold back the checkout, leave it out for three days without looking at it, and then re-evaluate whether if you still need to buy it. This trick could help you reducing your desire to buy something. Because, in most cases, desire is temporary.',
